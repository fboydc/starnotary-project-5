# Ethereum Star Notary
This project shows a simple web application that interacts with a deployed smart contract in the Rinkeby network. Users can search and create planet and stars present in the ethereum blockchain. Currently only searching and creating stars is supported in the front-end application. However, the depoyed contract does support searching, creating, purchasing, and sale of stars and planets. I'm also working on a node API to support all above described functionalities.


# Where to start ? 
**If you just want to play with the application, skip all the testing, contract deployment, and API endpoints then:** 
- The `ROOT/frontend/`directory is where you need to be, so `cd` yourself into that folder
- Read onto and follow the instructions provided in the section labeled **"Running the Application"**.

**If you want to perform the tests provided, and or deploy the solidity contract, then:** 
- `cd` into the `ROOT/smart_contracts` directory
- Follow the instructions provided under **Testing and Deploying the Smart Contract**

**If you want to test the API endpoints provided, then:**
- `cd` into the `ROOT/backend` directory
- Follow the instructions provided under **Smart Contract API Endpoints**
